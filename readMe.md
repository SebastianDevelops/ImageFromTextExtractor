# Image Text Extraction API Documentation

## Overview

The Image Text Extraction API is a simple web service built in Python using Flask and Tesseract OCR. It allows users to submit an image containing text as a parameter and receive the extracted text from the image as a response.

## Usage

### Endpoint

The API exposes a single endpoint for text extraction:

- **Endpoint URL:** `/extract_text`
- **Method:** POST

### Request

The client should make a POST request to the `/extract_text` endpoint with a multi-part form containing the image file to be processed. The image file should be included in the request under the parameter name `image`.

#### Example using cURL

```bash
curl -X POST -F "image=@path/to/your/image.jpg" http://127.0.0.1:5000/extract_text
```

Replace `path/to/your/image.jpg` with the actual path to the image file you want to process.

### Response

The API will respond with a JSON object containing the extracted text:

```json
{
  "text": "Extracted text from the image."
}
```

If an error occurs during the processing, the response will include an error message:

```json
{
  "error": "Error message details."
}
```

## Installation

1. Install required Python packages:

   ```bash
   pip install flask pytesseract pillow
   ```

2. Install Tesseract OCR on your system. Follow the installation instructions provided on the [official Tesseract GitHub page](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract).

3. Save the provided Python script (`app.py`) in a file.

4. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

   The API will be accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/extract_text`.

## Dependencies

- Flask: A web framework for building the API.
- PyTesseract: A Python wrapper for Tesseract OCR.
